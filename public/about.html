<h2>Passions</h2>
<p>I want to carry out my passions and hobbies for life and to not have to compromise, I believe if I can find a way to do what I love and make a living, than I should consider this a rich life, because the money will follow. 
<br/> 
</p> 
<p> My dream is to become an entrepreneur in the fight world, bringing more money to the community I love and perhaps even making a name for myself in the fight game whilst I'm at it. </p>
